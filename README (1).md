# BloomCare Demo (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a minimal demo project containing the `BreastCancerApp.jsx` single-file React component you provided.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Node.js (>= 16) and npm installed.
2. Extract the zip and open the project folder in terminal.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Notes
- Tailwind is pre-configured. If Tailwind classes don't render, ensure `npm install` completed successfully.
- The app stores data in `localStorage`. To reset demo users/patients, clear localStorage in your browser devtools.
- The included `downloads/breast_images_notepad.zip` link in the app is a placeholder — you can put sample images in `public/downloads/`.
